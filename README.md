Custom Question-Answering Chatbot using RAG

Project Overview
This project involves the development of a custom question-answering chatbot leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique. The chatbot is designed to provide accurate answers based on personal information retrieved from my CV.

Features

Utilizes RAG for improved question answering.
Retrieves relevant context from stored text.
Generates accurate responses using a fine-tuned model.
Computes cosine similarity to rank retrieved information.


How It Works

Data Processing: Extracts and processes relevant information from the CV.
Embedding Generation: Converts textual data into vector embeddings.
Retrieval Mechanism: Uses cosine similarity to find the most relevant context.
Response Generation: Passes the retrieved context to a language model for answer generation.
